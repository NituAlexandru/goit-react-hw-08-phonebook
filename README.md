Acceptance Criteria
Use this template as a starting point for your React project to kick off your application.

- The repository goit-react-hw-08-phonebook is created.
- For submitting homework, there are two links: to the source files and to the working page on GitHub Pages.
- When running the code, there are no errors or warnings in the console.
- Each component has a separate folder with a React file and a style file.
- PropTypes are described for all components.
- Contact Book
Add functionality for registration, login, and user update in the "Contact Book" application as well as working with a private collection of contacts.

Backend
For this task, a backend is prepared. Check the documentation. It supports all the necessary operations with the contact collection, as well as registration, login, and user update using JWT. Use it instead of your own backend created with the help of the mockapi.io service.

Routing
Add routing, using the React Router library. The application should have several pages:

- /register - a public route for registering a new user
- /login - a public route for logging in an existing user
- /contacts - a private route for working with the user's contact list
- Add the Navigation component, which contains links to navigate these routes.
